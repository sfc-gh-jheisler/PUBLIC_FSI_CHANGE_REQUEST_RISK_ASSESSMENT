   "source": "# Change Request Risk Assessment\n#### Author: **John Heisler** - Senior AI Specialist, Financial Services, Snowflake\nIn this notebook, we're going to evaluate a new change request and determine a risk score for that change request resulting in target environment instability.\n\nThe notebook is written to allow deployment directly into anyone's environment.\n\n## Hit the Nail, Don't Build the Hammer!\nUltimately, AI should drive commercial value. To that end, building, deploying, and maintaining the systems that underpin that commercial value need to be easy, efficient, and trusted. \nEnterprises that maximize efforts leveraging their differentiated domain knowledge and creativity will ultimately win the AI race. Every ounce of effort spent on managing/building/tuning AI is a distraction from delivering value and thus comes at a material opportunity cost. With Snowflake Cortex AI, we aim to maximize efforts wielding the power of AI, not building it.\n\n## Use Case Commercial Value\nOur solution drives **operational alpha** by maximizing uptime of production environments. This solution provides operational alpha in at least these four ways:\n1. **System Uptime**: The systems critical to support our portfolio teams will be more stable and provide maximum value to our portfolio teams' performance.\n2. **Regulatory Reporting**: Minimize need for reporting to external regulators about critical system downtime and its impact.\n3. **Opportunity Cost**: Minimizing time spent conducting emergency maintenance which can be repurposed to focus on alpha-generating solutions.\n4. **Opportunity Cost**: Minimize need for time-and-resource-intensive root cause analysis and these cross functional teams can focus on their primary responsibilities.\n\n## Process Outline\nBefore we got here, using the harbinger_data_creation.ipynb notebook in this repo, we created and filled a change request table with some synthetic data (Fun Fact: You we use LLMs to do that-- check out the aforementioned notebook to see how).\n\n1. Build a python function to house our prompt and accept a change request as context. this approach streamlines our code and decouples the prompt from our broader development, allowing for independent development on the prompt by domain experts.\n2. Build a complete function to streamline passing of parameters to our complete function.\n3. Generate Risk Scores and Reasonings with batch inference whereby we generate a risk score for change requests as they appear in our system.\n4. Build a UI to allow the end user to interact with the AI.   \n    * Summary Interface: leveraging the data that we persisted from our batch inference in step 3, render the results for review. This portion of the infercae is great for weekly reviews of change requests\n    * Ad Hoc/Exploratory Interface: Allow an end user to pass a Change Request to an LLM of their choosing to explore how different LLMs perform on this task.\n\n\n## Solution Differentiators\n* **LLM fungibility**: We have a model garden right here in Snowflake-- no need to manage divergent infrastructure and no need for external calls which introduce risk into your system\n* **Obeying the Laws of Data Physics**: We develop, perform inference, and host the UI in the same compute environment that the data resides-- eleminating bloated architectures and complexity associated with managing the data, inference, and UI in seperate infrastructures. \n\n## Art of the Possible\nHere is some food for thought and hopefully inspiring enhancements for your deployment. \n\n* **Fine Tuning**: If we have tied incidents' root causes to change requests in the past, we could fine tune a model here in Snowflake with that data and the task that we're after. This has a couple of very interesting advantages. first, we would have a very specialize model that may perform this task very well because it has \"experience\" with what good and bad looks like. More operationally focused, we could maybe use a smaller model maximizing cost efficiencies.\n* **More Context - Metadata**: we could offer much more context about what each column in the data set means and fully define the json structure that we're passing. This would inform the model on the meaning of each column rather than allowing it to come up with its best guess at the columns.\n* **More Context - Target System Stability (Windshield)**: We could use another LLM upstream of the final risk inference to build a synopsis of the target system stability and status. For instance, it could state things like, \"the target system for EDM-Account-Master has seen several out of memory alerts and disc space errors in the last six weeks.\" We would instruct the risk prompt to consider that environment when deriving its risk assessment which should enhance its predictions.\n* **More Context - Incident Root Causes (Rear view Mirror)**: We could pass a synopsis of the last 6 months of root causes to the model. This would make it keenly aware \\"
