Data Sync Tool Setup: Configuring a data sync tool for real-time data synchronization between the on-premises and cloud-based storage. Testing will be performed in the staging environment (CloudStorage-Staging) to ensure data integrity and application performance. Expected downtime is approximately 1 hour during the migration process.', '2024-01-08', 'Improved scalability and reliability with minimal downtime', 'within release window', 'moderate risk', 'planned release', 'approved', 'no peer review', 'planned');",
